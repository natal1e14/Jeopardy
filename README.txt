This program simulates the game show Jeopardy.
It was written using Python 2.7 in 2017, and as such will encounter errors
if run using a newer version of Python.

To start the game, run the runner.py file.

Gameplay instructions can be found in the User Manual file, or by selecting
"Manual" from the menu bar during gameplay.

Please refer to the terminal if the program appears to crash - you may need
to type something in for further gameplay.

Alternatively, you can change the font on Line 61 to a font of your choice.

Part of this assignment was to act as if the final product was to be sold and to come up with a company name. It is not actually for sale.
